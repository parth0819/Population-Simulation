### Abstract

We create a simulation modeling population growth, building upon the work of D J Aldous. Aldous creates an elementary model of city growth, akin to the "Chinese restaurant process". His two determinants of growth are α and β, which are two constants which influence the behavior of the simulation. However, the real world is the result of a myriad of factors, and we wish to better illustrate that. Thus, we add further parameters to Aldous’s paper to represent a more accurate depiction of real world behaviors. Added features include "fitness", representing age and health, which influence tendencies for individuals to migrate based on preference and conditions. In addition, we have six inputs that dictate the behavior of the model’s growth. In addition to Aldous’s α and β, we utilize B, birthrate, C0, a constant of influence, c, the rate of immigration, and m, an indication of when people migrate. Together, these inputs and factors create a more realistic sample of real world city growth phenomena. An analysis of the resulting data yields many patterns regarding total population, expected number of cities, the emergence of an infinite population, and critical points.
